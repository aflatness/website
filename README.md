## About

This repo is for my software engineering website and portfolio. I utilized Next.js not only for the ease of routing and server-side rendering, but to learn a new framework. I've had a blast creating this website, learning Next.js, and honing my SEO skills. I hope you take a look and enjoy what I have to offer as a software engineer!

### Built With

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
